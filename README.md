# Tech-Academy-Projects
While studying at The Tech Academy I completed several assignments and worked on multiple projects in order to build my skills and proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, SQL, C# and the .NET framework. I was taught how to think like a programmer in order to find creative solutions while writing clean and precise commented code. Completing these assignments and projects taught me several programming skills and gives me the confidence that I can learn any language or framework fairly quickly.

## Python Live Project using Django Framework
After completing the Python course, I participated in a two week sprint. I was tasked with using Python within the Django framework to create a dynamic web application. I chose travel as my topic and I built a destinations website that allows a user to create, review, update and delete information about their favorite travel destinations. I used several functions in the views in order to retrieve data and display them on the applicable HTML template. Additionally, I connected an API and wrote a basic JSON response that allows the user to view the current temperature at that specific destination. Ideally, I would have utilized data scraping and API's to display the current flight price, which I plan to implement in the future. 

### Creating the Basic App
To start, I created a new application within the Django framework. I created base and home templates and then added function to the views in order for a homepage with a navbar to render. I then registered my URL's and linked my application to the main project home page.
